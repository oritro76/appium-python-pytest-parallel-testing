Exercise template for automation for Mobile devices.

**QA AUTOMATION HOMEWORK**

Are you the the type of person with a keen eye for details, thriving for quality, with the technical passion of automating tests cases as much as possible but without fear on getting hands dirty with manual tasks? Show us what you are capable of, you will have the opportunity to taste a bit of what a Chocorian QA face everyday, so feel free to shine and show us your amazing skills.

**PROCESS**

1. This repo is your own, you can use it to work and commit your solution here.
2. Solve the exercise within a timeframe of 1 week. It normally takes around 3-6 hours to complete.
3. We review your solution within 2 days, provide feedback for you and schedule a call to discuss as a next step.
4. Demo your solution to future colleagues (product managers and engineers) on the call.

The app should contain the following features:

**MANUAL TESTING** 

Take a look to our test Android Choco app
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19B6TMMfwhrX3sYpx76Gw9Yq0Zmax7O96/view?usp=sharing), and according of what you see please write test cases (using Gherkin syntax) all the features and scenarios you can think of.

**AUTOMATION TESTING** 

From the list of proposed test cases, implement a subset from your proposed list (Choose according your own prioritisation criteria).

Also imagine the scenario were you have to implement the same set of tests for the iOS app, so write the solution thinking of this parametrisation.

**Credentials:**

**phone nunmber:** +4916200000001

**daily code:** 1234

**RULES**

This task should be completed in **one week (7 days).**

We have a preferred tech stack below to be used for the solution, but you can use any other tool you see fit and more familiar with. 
- **Java** 
- **Appium**
- **Cucumber**

In order to complete this test your app **must:**
- Compile with no errors
- Contain no crashes
   
 We expect that a badass Chocorian will follow these criteria:
- Architectural cleanliness / Patterns usage
- Well documented README.md to be able to run your solution
